A way to track my stocks in different accounts in a unified way. Using JavaScript, PHP, MongoDB, AJAX, Rickshaw.js, jQuery...

The goal is twofold: 

1. have a nice table that is fully functional (add, delete, modify records; and also sort by column);
2. have cool graphing abilities.  I currently have been using rickshaw.js for that.  One MAJOR ISSUE is that Yahoo's YQL (where I'm getting my data) is INTENSELY SLOW for large amounts of historical data.  

That is all.
