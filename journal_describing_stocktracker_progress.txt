Journal of what I'm doing with this StockTracker web app
========================================================

Currently, I'm working on:
http://localhost/stocktracker/table/stocks.php 
(obviously(?) in /var/www)

Why this is in the /table directory is that I was practicing making a nice 
table from the Head First HTML/CSS book (because it uses CSS to style the 
table). 

The /stocktracker directory *might* be named (some variant of) rickshaw 
elsewhere, because the original idea was to have very nice line graphs of 
my stocks, and I settled on the rickshaw library. 

Currently, the page shows a table with dummy values.
                                       ------------
I want to populate it with data from Mongo.                  <----done late June
------------------------------------------
Then I want the Add button to work with AJAX: 
to add a stock purchase asynchronously, and just reload the table,
not the whole page. 

But to summarize for now: i just want to populate the table from mongo.

exercises in storing JSON to MongoDB:

============
DONE: populating the table from MongoDB
TODO: Add a purchase to the db & table using a form and AJAX.

This is easier said than done because I want to blend a nice jQuery form with
AJAX feed-back (reload the table of stocks owned).  The adding of the stock
purchase is sent by the form to a PHP script.  

Right now, I can't get the data from the form to transfer (via POST) to the 
PHP script.  So the add functionality is DEAD IN THE WATER.  

various attempts so far (add a purchase to db and table):
http://localhost/stocktracker/stocktracker.php
file:///home/devon/rickshaw_javascript/addStockPopUpButton.html
http://localhost/stocktracker/table/example_AJAX_AddStringToDOM.html 
http://localhost/stocktracker/table/example_formOverlayUsingPOST.html
http://localhost/stocktracker/table/stocks.php <----the main one I want to work

looks very straight forward, source from jQuery:
