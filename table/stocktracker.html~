			<p>This is a tool to keep track of stocks in a single location with a uniform UI.</p>
			<p>The motivaiton for this site is when you owns stocks in several different accounts, at different companies,
				wih different logins, and each site present them differently, it gets annoying keeping track of all that.
				This is a place you can keep track of all your stocks on one page.</p>
			<p>Here, you can enter each individual purchase.  For example, you can enter IBM 100 different times at different prices purchased for different amounts, and in different accounts.</p>
			<p>I am not seeking to implement anything new, but rather to learn how to do all the cool stuff I see in disparate places online.</p>
			<p>So far, I have made this one page very AJAX-intensive.  It gets current information from Yahoo's YQL API.  I've also used D3.js for graphing, and I intend to use other graphing libraries to extend the usefulness of this site.  The data store is implemented with MongoDB (for me to practice using a NoSQL db), though I am strongly considering blending in a PostgreSQL db to practice good, old fashioned relational db things.</p>
